    <h1>Fruit Seeds and their Characteristics</h1>
    <h2>What are seeds?</h2>
   
    <p>Seeds are the basic building blocks of life for fruity plants. Ranging in size from a few millimeters long to several inches, seeds ar responsible for the creation of a new fruit(s), and are transmitted by animals and natural forces of the Earth, such as rain and wind.</p>
   
    <h3>How many can there be in a fruit?</h3>
    
    <p>The number of seeds a fruit has depends on what type of fruit it is. If it is a semi-large to large fruit, such as a melon or gauva, then it can have more than 20-40 seeds. With smaller fruits, such as apples or oranges, they only have 2-4 seeds, usually hidden in the core, or around the core of the fruit.</p>
    <h4>Are  fruit seeds edible?</h4>
    
    <p>Yes, all seeds are edible, but that does not mean that all of them are healthy or safe to ingest. Some seeds can cause nasty symptoms such as vomiting, aching, and diarrhea to occur. For example, the watermelon, a large watery fruit, has two types of seeds found in its body, black seeds and yellow seeds. Black seeds are harder to break down with the teeth and can cause the symptoms described above if swallowed. Yellow seeds are the complete opposite, and are soft and easy to chew, while also causing no harmful side effects from ingestion.</p>
    <p>Other examples of harmless edible seeds include the seeds in a tomato, which are small and and can be easily ingested and digested, and apple and orange seeds, which, even if they are bigger and harder to bite down on, are still edible and will not cause any side effects. </p>
